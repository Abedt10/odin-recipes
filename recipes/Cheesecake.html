    <li>1 cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided </li>
    <li>  1/4 cup hot, brewed coffee mixed with ¼ cup very hot water</li> 
    <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li> 14 ounces (4 bars) GODIVA Large 72% Dark Chocolate Bars, divided</li>
    <li> 16 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li> 1 cup granulated sugar</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p> <h2> Steps</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>   PREHEAT oven to 325°F. </li>
    <li>Mix cookie crumbs, melted butter and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a bowl until combined. Press mixture onto the bottom of the springform pan; set aside. Dissolve salt in hot coffee mixture; set aside. </li>
    <li>With a serrated knife, coarsely chop 3 ½ of the GODIVA Solid Dark Chocolate Bars; save the remaining ½ bar for garnishing the cake. Place chopped chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium (50% to 60% power) for 1 minute. Stir. Continue to heat in 30-second intervals until the chocolate is almost completely melted, but some small chunks remain. Stir until smooth, and cool slightly, about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Beat the cream cheese using an electric mixer at low speed, about 4 minutes or until creamy. Gradually add the remaining 1 cup sugar and beat until blended, at least 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Reduce speed to low and slowly beat in the coffee mixture and vanilla extract. Drizzle in melted chocolate and beat until blended. Pour mixture into prepared crust. </li>
    <li>Bake for 55 to 65 minutes or until cheesecake is puffed and center is set, but slightly wobbly; edges may have tiny cracks. Cool the cheesecake completely in the pan on a wire rack. Then cover the pan with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. </li>
